ASP.NET Web Deployment using Visual Studio
====================
> A 12-part tutorial series that shows how to deploy an ASP.NET web application to an Azure Website or a third-party hosting provider, by using Visual Studio 2012. Includes tutorials on deploying to IIS on the local computer, Web.config transformations, deploying SQL Server databases, and command-line deployment. The sample application used in the tutorial is a Web Forms project, but the procedures all apply equally to MVC.
